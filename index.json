Real ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment. The simulated ‘ants’ similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions. To deal with the complexity of different maps considering safety and path consistency is a problem which has to be addressed in path planning of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). In this paper, an efficient approach is introduced through combining improved Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm with cubic spline parametrization to provide smooth global route. Firstly, grid map is constructed. Initial cost policy is introduced for ant to search and performance of ant colony algorithm is improved through adding A* heuristic search and MAX_MIN ant system characteristics to enhance global searching ability. To improve localization and path consistency in global path, an evaluation function based on novel cost policy is introduced to evaluate path candidates in order to improve the quality of global path. At last, arc-length parametrization is applied to achieve path consistency and smoothness. The simulation results show optimal performance of this approach in complex maps including common and tunnel maps as compared with other versions of ACO algorithm.\n","date":1603287534,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603287534,"objectID":"c2f3ea49614bf64aff04dc0cd0756bec","permalink":"https://xinyuelan.github.io/project/path_generation/","publishdate":"2020-10-21T21:38:54+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/path_generation/","section":"project","summary":"We proposed an efficient approach through combining improved Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm with cubic spline parametrization to provide smooth global route.

The design of the robot and patio are based on Webots, an open-source robot simulator developed by Cyberbotics. The libraries and sensors available in Webots were involved in this project. Our team has been divided into several squads to study and apply the basic technologies on a robot to complete tasks using sensor nodes in Webots { environment building, tracking, color recognition, crossing bridge and arch, object recognition and throwing object into the virtual pond. To be specific, based on a Pioneer 3-AT prototype, 4 camera nodes were mounted as main sensors for path following, color recognition and object recognition since the cost was relatively low and the library of camera node was comprehensive in Webots; a compass was installed inside the robot to calculate the angle as it turning; in addition, a liftable gripper was assembled on the robot to drop the fish food by moving its finger nodes. Essential coding skills using C programming language were applied in our project to eliminate the potential problems and errors. By our joint effort in three months, a stable controller of the robot has been constructed successfully and its flawless performance in simulator verified the effectiveness of our design.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f67a2207d45adcd076a6d2610ad88642","permalink":"https://xinyuelan.github.io/project/tdps/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tdps/","section":"project","summary":"A low-cost vehicle equipped with multiple sensors is designed in Webots to complete specific tasks including color recognition, path following and dropping virtual fish food into pond.","tags":[],"title":"Rover Design in Webots to Complete Specific Tasks in Virtual Patios","type":"project"}]
